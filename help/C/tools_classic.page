  <title>Classic tools</title>

  <p>Various tools are available, most of them use the selected color: drawing
  with a left click uses the left color, while drawing with a right click uses
  the right color. The tool size and options are also important, and are
  available in the bottom bar.</p>

  <list>
    <item>
      <p>Pencil: The pencil draws following the pointer, and according to the
      chosen color. Its options include the shape of the lead, and the edition
      mode: use the "eraser" mode to delete existing colors.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Text: Insert text on the image. For better contrast, the text can use
      the secondary color for its shadow, or as a rectangle background.</p>
      <p>Don't forget to confirm the insertion using the <gui style="button">
      Insert here</gui> button.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Color picker: Select the color to use within the edited image.</p>

    <item>
      <p>Paint. This tool tries to paint an area with a color, which doesn't
      always work as expected so this tool is disabled by default.</p>

      of the lead, the use of dashes, and the possibility to draw arrows.</p>

      lead, the use of dashes, and the possibility to draw arrows.</p>

             src="figures/screenshot_arc.png" its:translate="no"/>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Shapes: Available shapes include rectangle, oval, circle, polygon, and
      free shape.</p>
      <p>Polygons and free shapes can be drawn in several clicks. To close them,
      do a last click at the position where you began the line, or use the
      <gui style="menuitem">Close shape</gui> menu item.</p>
      <p>Various filling options are available, with or without an outline,
      using a plain color or a gradient.</p>

  its capabilities are very powerful and useful for any image manipulation.</p>

  canvas or the selected area.</p>
